/**
 * GitLab hook, take.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @todo #1144:30min Create an implementation of GitLab API that will mirror
 *  the one we use for Github (Github class and friends). We only need those
 *  API endpoints that we use in farm project so don't try to implement the
 *  full API.
 * @todo #1144:30min Create a generic interface for hosted version control
 *  systems that we could use in stakeholders (and other classes) where we
 *  don't care about specific vendor (Github or Gitlab). Remember that besides
 *  the generic interface stakeholders have to have a way to find out if they
 *  are working with GitLab or GitHub. Most probably React and Rebound
 *  interfaces should be reworked to support such general vendor.
 * @todo #1144:30min Mimic the functionality of TkGithub in this class. For
 *  Gitlab we should support all the webhook notifications that we currently do
 *  for Github.
