/**
 * Guts.
 *
 * <p>This is a rather primitive supplementary monitoring system,
 * to allow us check what's going on inside all those Farm decorators.
 * The full report is rendered by {@link com.zerocracy.farm.guts.TkGuts}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each Farm, if it wants to expose something, returns an instance
 * of class {@link com.zerocracy.farm.guts.Guts} out of its method
 * {@link com.zerocracy.Farm#find(java.lang.String)}. The list of projects
 * will contain only one project {@link com.zerocracy.farm.guts.GsProject},
 * if the query is equal to {@link com.zerocracy.farm.guts.Guts#QUERY}.
 * This is exactly what {@link com.zerocracy.farm.guts.TkGuts} is using
 * as a query string.</p>
 *
 * <p>The returned {@link com.zerocracy.farm.guts.GsProject} builds
 * a Xembly response with some system information, injected there by
 * every corresponding Farm.</p>
