 * sensitive credentials used in PMO project.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is used in the decoration chain, in the constructor
 * {@link com.zerocracy.farm.SmartFarm#SmartFarm SmartFarm(Farm)}, which is the
 * Farm entry point used in {@link com.zerocracy.entry.Main#exec Main.exec()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Also, {@link com.zerocracy.farm.props.PropsFarm} may be used directly
 * in tests where PMO is needed, in order to have access to the properties.</p>
