/**
 * Stakeholder which collects execution metrics.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @todo #1172:30min Add performance metrics: add measurement of time taken
 *  to execute Measured stakeholder. Time taken must be saved to mongodb
 *  instance on database "metrics", collection "time_taken". Fields to be saved:
 *  "stakeholder" with stakeholder class qualified name, "claim_type" with
 *  claim type, "date_time" with datetime of execution, "time_taken" with time
 *  taken to stakeholder process claim. After this decorate StkRuntime so it
 *  could really collect the metrics and fix test in MeasuredText
 *  .collectTimeTakenToExecute if needed.
 * @todo #1172:30min Add performance metrics: add measurement of other
 *  performance metrics (track S3 artifacts download, xml document
 *  modifications, footprint access) and save the to mongodb under database
 *  "metrics".
